  Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with strong,
  flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth
  adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory
  ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency
  for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They
  can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color
  vision and a better sense of smell than humans.
